# color-hash

**Generate a color based on a value**

This module generates a color based on an object, by calculating a color value
based on a hash value for the object. This means the result is deterministic:
the same value will always result in the same color (so long as the hash
function remains deterministic).

This module is a port of the [color-hash Javascript library](https://github.com/zenozeng/color-hash).
It supports Python 3.6+.

## Quick Start

```python
>>> from colorhash import ColorHash
>>> c = ColorHash('Hello World')
>>> c.hsl
(131, 0.65, 0.5)
>>> c.rgb
(45, 210, 75)
>>> c.hex
'#2dd24b'
```

## Installation

Its hosted on PyPI.

```bash
pip install colorhash
```

## Changelog

- color-hash 1.2.0 *(2022-10-17)*
  - Use typing supporting python3.6
- color-hash 1.1.0 *(2022-09-01)*
  - Add tests
  - Add installation instructions
- color-hash 1.0.4 *(2021-11-30)*
  - Support only for python 3.6+
  - Add tests
- color-hash 1.0.3 *(2020-12-04)*
  - Drop support for python 2
  - Handover of project maintenance
- color-hash 1.0.2 *(2016-07-08)*
  - Add ``crc32_hash`` function and set default hashfunc to that. It's not
    fully backwards-compatible, but I don't want to bump the version a lot for
    not doing my research.

  - Initial port.
