# StuffMyFridge: A Grocery Product Recommender
The goal of this notebook is to build a grocery product recommendation system for users of the Instacart app. Instacart is a company that deliveres groceries from local stores. We will use “The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”, which can be found in https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017.
